### Student grade managment helper tool for use in class

Written in C# for Windows upon request of a former teacher. Used as an replacement for manual list keeping of student participation and missing homework, as well as for later calculation of oral grades. Grades are updated live. Students are represented in a grid corresponding to their seating.
