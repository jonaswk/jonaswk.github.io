Before this, I studied at RWTH Aachen University, where I also worked as a student research assistant at the [chair for information systems](http://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/cms), on projects associated with the [las2peer platform](https://las2peer.org/), mainly the [Community Application Editor](https://github.com/rwth-acis/CAE), used for generating applications from visual models for use on the mentioned platform.
