I am a computer science student from Germany, living in Munich, where I'm currently studying for my master's degree at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

Before this, I studied at RWTH Aachen University, where I also worked as a student research assistant at the [chair for information systems](http://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/cms), on projects associated with the [las2peer platform](https://las2peer.org/), mainly the [Community Application Editor](https://github.com/rwth-acis/CAE), used for generating applications from visual models for use on the mentioned platform.

I mainly program in Java, C++, Python, JavaScript and R (in no particular order). I'm interested in data science, machine learning, general software engineering and I sometimes venture into computer graphics, trying to improve my basic knowledge of the field.
