title: Notifying the house about deliveries - Part 1
---

Living in a big apartment block with my window facing the street, I can see whenever the big yellow DHL van parks in front of the house. As I had a Raspberry Pi lying around and my webcam is currently not in use most of the time I asked myself if I could use both to send notifications to my fellow block dwellers whenever the delivery van arrives. As I'm currently also taking a machine learning class, I tried to apply what I've learned to achieve this.

So first thing was setting up the Raspberry Pi with the webcam to watch the street below my window. I'll skip the details on preparing the sd card for your pi and all that stuff. If you want to learn how this works visit [the offical setup guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/setup/).
