After working on it in parallel to my thesis / to my day job, I'm quite pleased to announce that my first iOS App has been released.
Take a look at [classmatecount.com](https://classmatecount.com)!

It's an app to help teachers reach a fair evaluation of their students' oral grades easier and was developed in cooperation with a former high-school teacher of mine.

I used this opportunity to dive deep in to iOS development and to improve my Swift skills. Something I wanted to do for quite some time now. Now let's see where this leads to!
