title: NCDU - Disk Usage Tool
categories: posts
---

Want to see where all your disk space has gone? Of course, on *nix systems there is `du`, but there are nicer ways to get an overview of disk usage. One is [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) which is `du` with an ncurses interface (plus some features). Meaning, one can browse the `du` results interactively in the terminal.

For mac, install via `brew install ncdu`. Great tool for personal use and on remote servers, should run in every POSIX environment with ncurses installed!
